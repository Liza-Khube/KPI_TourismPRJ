    <h1>Tips For Your Trips</h1>
    <p>
      Travel smarter, not harder. Use these essential tips to pack right, save money, and stay safe
      on your journey.
    </p>
    <h2>Bring local money, even if they accept your currency</h2>
    <p>
      You might think that going to Mexico or Puerto Rico or many Caribbean/Central American
      countries would permit you to simply bring cash in USD and you’re right. BUT you’ll also be
      ripped off with a brutal conversion rate. We realized this the first (and second) time we
      visited Mexico so we promptly converted some US to MEX pesos and saved so much money. It also
      made tipping a lot easier, as we had a lot more smaller bills to spare with our pesos.

    <h2>Check the weather before booking and packing</h2>
    <p>
      This might come as an obvious one but if your trip can be anytime in the year, try to find a
      middle ground between favourable pricing for low season and favourable weather. It wouldn’t be
      fun to visit a place in the middle of hurricane season, for example if you could have avoided
      it! And of course, you want to pack light but also ensure you’re comfortable with the range of
      temperature and weather conditions you’ll be meeting in your destination. A thin windbreaker
      is the most versatile piece of clothing for colder and warmer weather ranges. Make it a habit
      of checking your weather app prior to each trip!
    </p>
    <h2>Try public transit</h2>
    <p>
      I think that walking around, eating local foods and checking out local shows/festivals aren’t
      the only ways to immerse yourself in the culture you’re visiting. Taking public transit is one
      of the top methods to see what life is like for a local resident. It was definitely
      interesting getting on a train in Delhi during rush hour! Or getting so well acquainted with
      the transit system in Paris, Japan, New York, etc.

    <h2>Photocopy your documents</h2>
    <p>
      Photocopy your driver’s license, passport, visa, vaccination status (if required), and other
      important documents. Scan them in the cloud so they're accessible wherever you are.
    </p>
    <h2>Live every moment</h2>
    <p>
      Enjoy every moment of your trip and be ready for everything. If an adventure doesn't spring up
      unexpectedly, then it isn't an adventure. Don't fret about things that you can't control or
      change - let the trip take its own course. Change what you can in case the trip isn't going
      according to your liking but don't spoil your possibly great vacation due to unnecessary
      worry.
