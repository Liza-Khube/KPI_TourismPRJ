        Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the most important traditional
        holiday in China. It’s celebrated on the first day of the Chinese lunar calendar, which
        usually falls between late January and mid-February. The festival is marked by family
        reunions, exchanging red envelopes with money, and eating traditional Chinese food like
        dumplings and glutinous rice cakes.

        No, it is a myth that Londoners or British people in general stop everything to drink tea
        specifically at 5 PM daily. While tea is a very popular, daily beverage, the formal
        “afternoon tea” (tea with cakes/sandwiches) is mostly a treat or tourist activity, not a
        strict daily routine.

        Yes, the Sahara Desert is in Africa, and it makes up about one-third of Africa’s landmass.
        This fact leads many people to think that the majority of Africa is sweltering hot and vast,
        open land of emptiness. The truth, however, is that deserts aren’t necessarily hot all the
        time and much of Africa is not a desert.
